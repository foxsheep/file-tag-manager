## Synopsis

Small program to manage files, with tag and author based searching and data persistance

## Why do this?

I was looking for a simple program to manage all my scans and documents, and provide a simple 'search by tag' functionality.

## How do I run it?

You can download the source code and import the project to Visual Studio to build it (probably not stable). Alternatively, you can download the latest stable version from the releases page.

## External packages needed?

WindowsAPICodePack is needed for some of the program's functionalities, most notably the file thumbnails.

## How to actually use the program?
